# Problem Statement

KindSure is an insurance company which is into providing general insurance like Car, House, Travel, Corporate etc.

Ravi, the marketing head of KindSure, approaches you to help them with their analytics so that his team can make more informed decisions. Some of the articulated problems are as follows, but he is also open to any ideas and suggestions you can make.

1. Understand which marketing channels are working best for them and which campaigns across the channels are providing the best ROI.
1. They currently spend money across different channels and donâ€™t have a single view of their marketing spends, activity and performance at a single place.
1. Given the large number of campaigns they run across various channels, they find it very hard be able to reconcile similar campaigns across channels
1. Given the nature of their business a lot of transactions happen both offline( at stores, distributors), online (through websites). The transaction data which comes from distributors can sometimes be as late as 30-45 days.
